Node Graph: The node graph is a brand-new way to configure event logic. You no longer need KubeJS to define complex functionality. If you're a user of Blender or Shader Graph, you're going to love this new feature.

MBD2 allows you to listen to various machine events through the node graph and set up a wide range of execution logic, giving you immense creative power.
